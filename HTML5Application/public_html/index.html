                    <h1>GAME</h1>
                    <p>    I love playing games for the joy they bring, but I love 
                        creating games more for the many emotions they bring and take. It is frustrating for 99% of the time,
                        but the 1% of hapiness when finish a game is comparable by nothing at all. Actually, 
                        that 1% feels so good that I have devoted 
                a larger part of my free to in the last 4 years, and will devote even more 
                       in the years to come.                       
                    </p>               
                <li> <img src = "work.jpg">  <h1>CODE</h1> <p>
                       Coding, for me, is sexy for two reasons: what it can do and what I can't do.
                       Coding to me, is a mean to which I can create fun, cool, useful stuffs (such as this website).
                       At the same time, coding is a challenging work, one which has so many things to learn and so many questions
                       and problems that it feels like it takes my entire life to learn it, which is probably exactly what I will be doing.                  
                    </p> 
                <li> <img src = "writing.jpg">  <h1>WRITING</h1> <p>
                        I like writing for two reasons. One, I am good at it, or at least I am better at it than I am at any other art forms.
                        Secondly, it is a super effective way of conveying my thoughts and emotions to other people, one thing that I really suck at when I have 
                        to use any other medium. (Besides, my friends do like my stories, and the feeling of having an audience, though small, is just soooooooo good).
