THis is the analysis code sequence used to analyze the data from our eye-tracking framework. Feel free to modify and use the file anyway you want.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
cat("\014")
graphics.off()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
